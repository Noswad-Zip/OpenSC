Guide for creating your Minetest mod
====================================

1. Create all needed files and folders

    We are using the mod template, so we have the following 
    folder structure:
    
    mod_template/
        .git/
            ...
        models/
            models_here.txt
        schems/
            schematics_here.txt
        sounds/
            sounds_here.txt
        textures/
            textures_here.txt
        depends.txt
        description.txt
        GUIDE.txt
        init.lua
        LICENSE.txt
        mod.conf
        README.md
        screenshot.png
    
    Rename the folder (mod_template) with your mod's name.
    
    Delete the .git folder (on *nix-systems you mostly have
    to enable 'Show hidden files' or something like that,
    or try to press Ctrl+h or Alt+.).


2. Customize files

    depends.txt:
    ------------
    Add all mod names, your mod is depending on in a
    separate line. If your mod has no dependencies, then
    we don't have to do here anything.
    
    description.txt:
    ----------------
    Add a short description about what your mod does and
    remove the existing one.
    
    init.lua:
    ---------
    Replace 'modname' with your mod's name (ll. 1,5).
    
    If you spilt your code into multiple files, check that
    the 'header' (ll. 1-3) is existing (and fits to the
    name).
    
    LICENSE.txt:
    ------------
    Follow the insturctions on the comment lines (--).
    
    mod.conf:
    ---------
    Replace 'modname' with your mod's name.
    
    README.md:
    ----------
    Follow the insturctions on the comment lines (--).
    
    screenshot.png:
    ---------------
    Replace with your one. It's pixel aspect ratio has to be
    3:2, common resolutions are 360x240 and 480x320.
    
    The black border in the example is optional of course.
    
    It's recommended to optimize your screenshot with eg.
    optipng and advpng (yes, both), to decrease the
    file size.


3. Write the code and add media


4. Clean up
    
    Remove these files:
    
    modname/
        models/
            models_here.txt
        schems/
            schematics_here.txt
        sounds/
            sounds_here.txt
        textures/
            textures_here.txt
        GUIDE.txt
    
    And now remove all folders that are empty.


5. Publish
